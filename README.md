Transitions in CSS


Remember that mixins behave just like functions
and you define them once and then inlude

Taking time to  do something

Variables and mixins help you not to repeat the styles

z-index property:pushes an element behind
Sudo element after

absolute css property  is used when you wish to specify the exact position


100 VH ...css property whereby you take the whole height

Overflow hidden helps you to avoid any scroll bars

Wow CSS AND JS ARE POWERFUL

There are also sass for loops
